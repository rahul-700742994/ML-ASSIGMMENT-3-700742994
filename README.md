IN THE GLASS DATASET, THE ACCURACY OF LINEAR SVM IS BETTER THAN SVM AND NAIVE BAYES METHOD. SVM'S CHOOSES DECISION BOUANDARY THAT MAXIMIZES THE DISTANCE FROM THE NEAREST DATA POINTS OF ALL THE CLASSES WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM NAIVE BAYES ALGORITHM. THE DECISION BOUNDARY CREATED BY SVM'S IS CALLED THE MAXIMUM MARGIN CLASSIFIER OR THE MAXIMUM MARGIN HYPERPLANE. SO THIS WHY  THE ACCURACY OF LINEAR SVM IS BETTER.
